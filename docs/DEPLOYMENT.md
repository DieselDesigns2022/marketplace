# Deployment

## Environment

- Live URL: `https://marketplace.dieseldesigns.co`
- VPS path: `/var/www/marketplace.dieseldesigns.co`
- Stack: Ubuntu, Nginx, PHP 8.3, MariaDB
- Error log: `/var/log/nginx/marketplace.error.log`

## Source of truth

GitHub is the source of truth. The VPS is the deployment and testing target. Codex is temporary and must not be treated as permanent source control.

## Before each phase

1. Remove old scattered backup files from the project tree.
2. Create a fresh project `.tar.gz` backup.
3. Create a fresh database `.sql` backup.
4. Confirm backups are outside committed source control.
5. Confirm `.env`, public uploads, and protected uploads are not committed.

## Pull a branch on VPS

```bash
cd /var/www/marketplace.dieseldesigns.co
git fetch origin
git checkout <branch-name>
git pull --ff-only origin <branch-name>
```

## Pull main after merge

```bash
cd /var/www/marketplace.dieseldesigns.co
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

## Migration workflow

1. Back up database first.
2. Review migration SQL.
3. Apply only migrations needed for the branch/merge.
4. Verify schema and core workflows after migration.
5. Keep `database/schema.sql` aligned with current schema when schema changes are made.

Example:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p <database> < database/migrations/<migration-file>.sql
```

## Upload folder permissions

Upload folders must be writable by the PHP/Nginx runtime user but must not be committed to Git. Public preview uploads may be web-accessible. Protected product files must not be directly web-accessible.

## Error log

Use the Nginx/PHP error log for HTTP 500 triage:

```bash
sudo tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/marketplace.error.log
```

## Rollback notes

- Source rollback: check out the last known good Git commit or restore the project `.tar.gz` backup.
- Database rollback: restore the last known good database `.sql` backup.
- Always capture current broken state/logs before rollback if possible.
- After rollback, smoke test public, auth, buyer, seller, admin, cart, checkout, and downloads.

## Phase 6 SEO deployment notes

Before requesting indexing, set `APP_URL=https://marketplace.dieseldesigns.co` in the current build/test deployment or rely on the current fallback. After deployment, verify `https://marketplace.dieseldesigns.co/robots.txt`, `https://marketplace.dieseldesigns.co/sitemap.xml`, public canonicals, and noindex behavior for private workflow pages. Treat `https://assetmoth.com` as the future domain migration target after purchase and DNS/application migration. Submit the sitemap in Google Search Console only after production content, support process, and owner legal/privacy review are complete.
